# üñºÔ∏è Image Classification with TensorFlow & PyTorch  

## üìå What is this project?  
This project is a deep learning-based **image classification model** implemented in both **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**. The goal is to explore different approaches to training, optimizing, and deploying an image classifier while comparing the two frameworks.  

### üöÄ Features:
- **Dual Implementation**: The model is built using both **TensorFlow (Keras)** and **PyTorch**.  
- **Dataset Handling**: Supports real-world image datasets with preprocessing techniques.  
- **Performance Comparison**: Evaluates ease of use, flexibility, and deployment options.  
- **Visualization**: Uses TensorBoard (for TensorFlow) and Matplotlib for insights into training progress.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How does it work?  
1. **Dataset Preprocessing**  
   - Loads an image dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet, or a custom dataset).  
   - Applies transformations such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation.  

2. **Model Building**  
   - Implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using both TensorFlow and PyTorch.  
   - Uses layers like Convolution, Batch Normalization, Dropout, and Fully Connected layers.  

3. **Training & Evaluation**  
   - Trains the model on the dataset with optimized hyperparameters.  
   - Evaluates accuracy, loss, and other performance metrics.  
   - Visualizes training progress using TensorBoard (TensorFlow) and Matplotlib (PyTorch).  

4. **Deployment Readiness**  
   - TensorFlow model can be deployed with **TensorFlow Serving or TensorFlow Lite**.  
   - PyTorch model can be converted using **TorchScript for deployment**.
